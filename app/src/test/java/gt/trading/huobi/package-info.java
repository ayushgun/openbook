/**
 * This package contains unit tests for the classes in the main package.
 *
 * Each test class corresponds to a class in the main package and contains test
 * methods that exercise the functionality of the corresponding class.
 *
 * Currently, the tests have not been implemented. It is recommended that you do
 * not attempt to run them.
 *
 * The tests are designed to be run using a testing framework such as JUnit, and
 * require the main package classes to be properly implemented in order to pass.
